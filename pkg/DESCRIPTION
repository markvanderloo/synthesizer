Description: Synthesize numeric, categorical, mixed and time series data. Data 
    circumstances including mixed (or zero-inflated) distributions and missing
    data patterns are reproduced in the synthetic data. A single parameter allows
    balancing between high-quality synthetic data that represents correlations of
    the original data and lower quality but more privacy safe synthetic data
    without correlations. Tuning can be done per variable or for the whole
    dataset.
