Description: Synthesize numeric, categorical or mixed data. Data circumstances
    including mixed (or zero-inflated) distributions and missing data patterns are
    reproduced in the synthetic data. A single parameter, allows balancing between
    high-quality synthetic data that represents correlations of the original data
    and lower-quality but more privacy-safe synthetic data without correlations.
    Tuning can be done per variable or for the whole dataset. Computing can be sped
    up using paralellized data synthesis.
