Description: Data is synthesized using a combination of inverse transform
    sampling using the empirical quantile functions for each variable, and 
    then copying the rank order structure from the original dataset. The
    syntesizer method has a tunable parameter allowing to gradually move
    from realistic and possibly unsafe synthetic data to decorrelated data
    of less utility.
